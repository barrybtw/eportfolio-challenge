            I am an 18-year-old frontend software engineer based in Denmark,
            Jylland. I am not comfortable with settling, and Iâ€™m always looking
            for an opportunity to learn more and increase my skill set.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I am working on solving difficult engineering problems by
            designing, building, and deploying websites that deliver a fantastic
            user experience.
            <br />
            <br />I work on personal and commercial projects every day to
            improve my comprehension of difficult programming concepts such as
            responsive website development, CSS layout, Promises, and API
            requests.
